I have a centralized Docker infrastructure called "cinfo" with the following services:

INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES (already running):
- Network: cinfo_app_network (Docker network)
- MariaDB: mariadb (port 3306)
- Redis: redis (port 6379)
- PHP-FPM: php (port 9000)
- Nginx:nginx (ports 80, 443)
- phpMyAdmin: phpmyadmin (port 8080)
- Grafana: grafana (port 3000)
- MailHog: mailhog (SMTP: 1025, Web UI: 8025)

RESERVED PORTS (do not use):
- 80, 443 (Nginx)
- 3000 (Grafana)
- 3306 (MariaDB)
- 6379 (Redis)
- 8025 (MailHog UI)
- 8080 (phpMyAdmin)
- 1025 (MailHog SMTP)

AVAILABLE PORT RANGES:
- 3001-3999 (for Node.js apps)
- 4000-4999 (for additional services)
- 5000-5999 (for Python/Flask apps)
- 8000-8999 (for Python/Django/FastAPI/php/html apps)
- 9001-9999 (for custom services)

Please create a application which considers the following requirements:

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create a complete docker-compose.yml that:
   - Connects to the docker "cinfo_app_network"
   - Uses available ports (suggest appropriate ports)
   - References services by name
   - Includes any app-specific services needed additionally

2. Create Dockerfile(s) with:
   - Proper base images
   - All necessary dependencies
   - Health checks
   - Production-ready configuration

3. Provide application code that:
   - Connects to mariadb for database operations
   - Uses redis for caching/sessions
   - Sends emails via -mailhog (for testing)
   - Includes proper error handling
   - Has environment variable configuration


Ensure the application:
   - Can run alongside other apps using the same cinfo infrastructure
   - Uses non-conflicting ports
   - Has proper container naming (prefix with app name)
   - Includes restart policies

CONNECTION DETAILS TO USE:
- DB_HOST=mariadb
- DB_PORT=3306
- REDIS_HOST=redis
- REDIS_PORT=6379
- MAIL_HOST=mailhog
- MAIL_PORT=1025

The database is to be created / connected using root password from the cinfo.env. The db name shall be the name of the app being built
Any celery or any services connecting to the above services also need to connect to the above ports.
The detailed information about cinfo container and typical configuration is given in cinfo-docker-compose.yml and cinfo.env files in the current folder
